When she finished her meal, the guard said, “We cooked your one-year-old son that we took from you, and this is what you just ate.”The faces behind this gruesome act of terror are devil-worshiping men who believe they are worshiping god and carry out unspeakably cruel acts against minorities in the Middle East daily. These men are taking women and children as sex slaves and massacring thousands every day.
